### Grid Size
- All simulations are in a 100x100 grid unless otherwise specified.

### Figure 3 Simulations
- Radiation dose of 10 洧냨洧녽 at 洧노 = 200
- For center radiation, target percentage is 0.7
- For spatial radiation, threshold percentage is 0.8 and radius is 10

### Figure 3 Early Model Simulations
- Early models are from earlier versions of the code.

### Scenarios Overview

| Scenario | Tumor Type                           | Immune Suppression Effect (洧랜) | Radiation Details                                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| A        | Tumor without radiation (Figure 2)   | 0.031                          | N/A                                                        |
| B        | Radiation-sensitive tumor (Figure 3) | 0.100                          | None                                                       |

| D        | Radiation-sensitive tumor (Figure 3) | 0.100                          | 10 洧냨洧녽 at 洧노 = 200, 85% of tumor area center radiated       |
| E        | Radiation-sensitive tumor (Figure 3) | 0.100                          | 10 洧냨洧녽 at 洧노 = 200, 100% of tumor area center radiated      |
