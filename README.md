# OnLattice2DGrid

## Overview
In the OnLattice2DCells folder is the OnLattice2DGrid class, a component of the HAL Modeling 2024 project. This class extends AgentGrid2D<CellFunctions> and serves as the foundation for modeling and simulating tumor and immune cell populations in a 2D grid environment. It supports agent-based simulations by facilitating cell interactions, movement, and other on-lattice dynamics. This Java code uses the Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) [1] to create a spatial agent-based model of an ordinary differential equations model [2] to simulate radio-immune response to spatially fractionated radiotherapy.

## Features
- Agents:
  1. Lymphocytes (blue)
  2. Triggering Cells (immune cells that attract lymphocytes to the tumor site, green)
  3. Tumor Cells (red)
  4. Doomed Cells (dead tumor cells, yellow)
- Agent Management: Tracks and manages agents (e.g., tumor and immune cells) within the 2D grid.
- Lattice-Based Simulation: Supports cell migration, proliferation, and other on-lattice behaviors.
- Customizable Interactions: Designed to work with various cell functions by integrating the CellFunctions class.
- Efficient Updates: Optimized for adding and removing multiple elements at each timestep, ensuring scalability for large simulations.
- Each timestep 1 random triggering cell is removed. Lymphocyte migration depends on the presence of triggering cells. 

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
- HAL Framework: Ensure the HAL framework dependencies are installed and properly configured.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/hannahgsimon/HALModeling2024.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd HALModeling2024/OnLattice2DCells
3. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
4. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

## Usage
Before running the code, you will need to update the file paths if any of the following booleans are set to true: printCounts, printProbabilities, printNeighbors, or writeGIF.

The simulation starts with the below initial conditions (modifiable in the code). You can update these parameters in the indicated lines of code to fit your specific simulation requirements.
- **Figure:** 2. There are figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each of which have different parameters as outlined in the FigParameters class.
    - *public static int figure = 2;*
- **Scenario Active:** false. If true, used for simulation testing of scenarios A, B, C, or D to study birfurcation of a tumor from controlled growth (immune limited) to uncontrolled growth (immune escape). The threshold is due to the value of immune suppression (*ùúÖ*).
    - *public static boolean scenarioActive = false; public static char scenario = 'A';*
- **Initial Cell Populations at Timestep 0:** 0 lymphocytes, 1 tumor cell, & 500 triggering cells
    - *int lymphocitePopulation = 0;
        int tumorSize = 1;
        int triggeringPopulation = 500;*
- **Grid Size:** 100 x 100 cells
    - *int x = 100;
        int y = 100;*
- **Timesteps:** 1000. The total number of timesteps for which the simulation runs.
    - *int timesteps = 1000;*
- **Total Radiation:** Disabled. Radiates the entire grid.
    - *public static boolean totalRadiation = false*
- **Center Radiation:** Enabled. Calculates the tumor's center at that timestep and radiates a specified percentage (modifiable via *public static double targetPercentage = 1;*) of the tumor in a circular area centered on that point.
    - *centerRadiation = true*
- **Spatial Radiation:** Disabled. Calculates the tumor's center at the current timestep and defines a circular area around it with a specified radius (modifiable via *public static int radius = 10;*). Additional circular areas are calculated to fit within the tumor, maintaining a 2-cell gap between adjacent circles and a 1-cell buffer between each circle and the tumor's edge. Each circle is radiated if the percentage of tumor and doomed cells within it meets or exceeds the specified threshold (modifiable via *public static double thresholdPercentage = 0.8;*).
    - *spatialRadiation = false*
- **Base Radiation Dose:** *0 Gy*. The default radiation dose applied to the entire grid during each timestep when radiation is turned off.
    - *public static int baseRadiationDose = 0*
- **Applied Radiation Dose:** *10 Gy*. The radiation dose delivered using the specified method (total, center, or spatial) during active radiation timesteps.
    - *appliedRadiationDose = 10*
- **Radiation Timesteps:** 200. The timesteps during which radiation is applied using the specified method (total, center, or spatial).
    - *public static List<Integer> radiationTimesteps = List.of(200);*
- **Print Counts:** Disabled. Outputs a CSV file with the following data at each timestep: populations of lymphocytes, triggering cells, all tumor cells, tumor cells previously exposed to radiation, all doomed cells, and doomed cells that are dead from radiation. Additionally, for the entire grid, it records the probabilities of lymphocyte death, tumor cell death from radiation, tumor cell death from immune system activity, and tumor cell division. It also prints the average surviving fraction of tumor cells (including the surviving fraction for radiation-exposed tumor cells during their last moment of radiation), primary immune response, secondary immune response, total immune response, the number of lymphocytes attempting to migrate onto the grid, and immune suppression effect.
    - *public static final boolean printCounts = false*
- **Print Probabilities:** Disabled. Outputs a CSV file with the following data for every cell on the grid at each timestep: type, color, whether it was previously exposed to radiation, the dose of radiation received that timestep, whether the cell is dead from radiation. It also records the probabilities of death, activation, death from radiation, death from immune system activity, and division. It also prints the number of lymphocyte neighbors in an adjacent cell (including diagonally).
    - *printProbabilities = false*
- **Print Neighbors:** Disabled. 
    - *printNeighbors = false*
- **Write GIF:** Disabled. Outputs a GIF file of the simulation.
    - *public static boolean writeGIF = false;*
- **Immune Suppression Effect Threshold:** Disabled. When enabled, the immune suppression effect (*ùúÖ*) dynamically adjusts at each timestep to its threshold value, as defined by equation 5 [2].
    - *public static boolean immuneSuppressionEffectThreshold = false;*
